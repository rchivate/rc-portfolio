        <h1>Ethics and Data</h1>
        <sub> Posted on January 27th, 2026 by Riya C</sub>
        <p>
            A data modeling practice can be ethically ambigious instead of straight black and white ethical or unethical. The problem that Data Scientists are trying to solve may be a legitimate problem that needs to be studied or figured out, but the extraction of data or the manipulation of data surrounding the problem may be unethical. One case that I can think of is if a Data Scientist wants to study the effects of a certain drug on patients with a specific disease. The problem is legitimate because the drug needs to be tested before it goes into the market. But the data extraction process is not the most ideal seeing that the drug would need to be tested on people. These people are not even regular, healthy individuals. This literally makes it a life or death scenario. Even though the intention may be there, the execution would not be ethical if they decided to test on live patients. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            I will list three practices that I think are beneficial to ensure ethical data modeling: Transparency, Data Auditing, and Stakeholder Engagement.
        </p>  
        <p>
            1. <b>Transparency:</b> Being open about the data sources, methods, and potential biases in the modeling process. This helps build trust and allows for external scrutiny. Transparency also reduces any surprises that the participants may encounter. They are well aware of all the aspects of the data collection/experiment/methodology. Communication is key in these types of scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. <b>Data Auditing:</b> Regularly reviewing and auditing data collection and processing methods to ensure they comply with ethical standards and regulations. This redices any biases that the data may have. This includes historical biases, gender bias, etc. This is to ensure that the data doesn't favor any group, individual, or an experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. <b>Stakeholder Engagement:</b> Involving stakeholders, including those who may be affected by the data modeling outcomes, in the decision-making process to ensure their perspectives and concerns are considered. This helps because the data scientist gets an outside perspective. when you are scrutinizing your own work, you do not find flaws. But when there is a third person who is looking at it from a clean slate perspective, they will be able to honestly tell you if there are any problems with the methodology.

        <h1>Context is important in Data Science</h1>
        <sub> Posted on January xxth, 2026 by Riya C</sub>
        <p>Context matters heavily in Data Science. Data can be manipulated in many different ways which sometimes lead
            to misleading results. For example, the classic example of the relationship between Ice Cream sales and
            Shark Attacks at the beach. The raw data proved that an increase in Ice Cream sales can lead to higher rates
            of Shark Attacks. If you look closesly at these two variables, there is no research or evidence that is
            backing this statement. Just because there is correlation between two variables does not mean that there is
            causation in any way. This is a prime example of when context matters. The data was collected during the
            season of Summer. Obviously, more people will go to the beach during the summer, and most likely buy ice
            cream. Because there are more people at the beach, there will be more recorded shark attacks because there
            are people for the sharks to attack.</p>
        <p>Modeling social topics and people are important in Data Science because they provide the necessary background
            and understanding to interpret data accurately and ethically. By keeping in mind the context of the data, we
            can ensure that our models are not only accurate but also fair and responsible. With great power comes great
            responsibility. Using data that are about real people helps us understand their situation in the context of
            the dataset. There are some measures that data scientists much ensure that they are taking to make sure that
            the people whose data is being used are not being harmed. For example, if there is a dataset with patients'
            data, the name and other sensitive data should not be available publicly. This is an invasion of privacy.
        </p>
        <p>I am hoping to better understand how to ensure that the data is used ethically and some steps that are
            necessary to take before manipulating the data. I also want to learn how to manipulate data so that it best
            represents the situation and the context in which the data was taken from.</p>
